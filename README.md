This repository hosts some code for practical bioinformatics applications. 

## GC_CONTENT 
This folder holds some programs for Guanine-Cytosine calculations. This value gives us significant information regarding the physical properties of DNA, and most importantly, its melting point. It can also help in other downstream applications such as species classification.<br>

This folder contains - <br>
* gc_content.ipynb  - Scans a fasta file, to assess each individual sequence and finds the sequence with the highest GC content.
